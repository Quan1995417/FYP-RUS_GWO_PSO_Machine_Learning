## An Evaluation of Natured-inspired Optimization Algorithms and Machine Learning Classifiers for Electricity Fraud Prediction

This study evaluated an algorithm level approach based on natured-inspired optimization algorithms which are Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO) and Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) to address imbalanced class problem. The method involves adaptively balancing the distribution and combine with supervised machine learning classifiers which are Artificial Neural Network (ANN),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient-Boosted Tree (XGBoost) and Random Forest (RF) to maximize the classification performance for electricity fraud case.
